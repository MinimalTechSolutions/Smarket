# AI-based Personal Finance Manager

**Project Description**: 
The goal of this project is to create an AI-based personal finance manager. The application will track the user's income and expenses, categorize them, and provide insights on spending habits. It will also suggest ways to save money and improve financial health.

**Features**:
1. **Expense Tracking**: The application should be able to track the user's expenses by integrating with bank accounts or through manual entry.
2. **Income Tracking**: Similarly, the application should track the user's income.
3. **Categorization**: The application should categorize expenses into different buckets like groceries, utilities, entertainment, etc.
4. **Spending Insights**: Based on the categorized data, the application should provide insights on spending habits.
5. **Budgeting**: The application should allow users to set budgets for different categories and notify them when they are close to exceeding their budget.
6. **Savings Suggestions**: Based on spending habits and income, the application should suggest potential areas for savings.

**AI Components**:
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For categorizing expenses and income, you can use NLP techniques to understand the context of each transaction.
2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: You can use ML algorithms to analyze spending patterns and suggest ways to save money.

Remember, while Mojo provides a great platform for developing machine learning models, you'll need to integrate it with a programming language like Python or Java to build the complete application.

I hope this gives you a good starting point for your project! Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
